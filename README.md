# implement game loop with win condition
    # Ensure players have a min of 3 cards when possible
    # Ensure there is a cli interface for this game loop

## Current issues:
- Players don't refill their hands to 3 cards afger playing 1
- CLI doesn't show the discard pile on the players turn
- Entering an index out of range crashes the game instead of prompting it to continue
